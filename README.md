# Changepoint Detection in Rust

Detects whether a changepoint exists, and if so, at which time step, in a sequence of
observations. `rust-changepoint` provides implementations of the algorithms described
in the ["Leveraging Cloud Data to Mitigate User Experience
from ‘Breaking Bad’" paper](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/nj89/docs/edm.pdf).
